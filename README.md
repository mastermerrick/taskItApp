Consumer productivity app to help manage time and tasks

Merrick Eng - Task Productivity App

# How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least 2 concrete examples
- I think I definitely learned a lot from this project. Here are some examples:
- Creating Radio Buttons - I created a Radio Button class and learned how to make my own subclass using the provided UIButton class and then extending its capabilities
- Color sets and global colors - I learned how to create my own color palette and design an aesthetically beautiful interface
- Tab Controller - I learned how to work with tab controller and have data persistence between different tabs, which was a bit different from navigation controller and didn’t involve segues in the same way.
- Using equitable class - I used the equitable interface in order to using the comparison operator == in my code.
- Different user controls - I worked with many new new user control features, including the date picker and the segmented controls. These elements were beautiful to incorporate into the app and made it feel more polished overall.
- CABasicAnimation - I worked with the CABasicAnimation class in order to animate a Pomodoro Timer onto the screen. I learned how to pause, resume, and reset the animation.

# What class material do you review? List at least 2 concrete examples
- Segues - I reviewed how to use segues between my different view controllers to ensure that data is passed off between screens appropriately.
- Table View Controller - I reviewed how we used Table View Controllers in order to display tasks, and then looked deeper into its capabilities to work with different sections as well as adding headers, colors, and changing the interaction of “Swipe to Delete.”

# Do you plan on continuing to work on this project?
- Yes I plan on continuing to work on it and add additional functionality / tweak capabilities:
- perhaps add a visual checkbox or ability to click on the row to delete it - adding a button is difficult though, and I’d want to control if the user clicks on a specific part.
- perhaps recreate the app in SwiftUI instead
- Enable drag and drop ordering for tasks to move into different buckets

# Any other questions, comments about the project or the class as a whole?
-No huge questions at the moment, but here are some small things on my mind:
-I couldn’t figure out how to really customize the header beyond bolding, customized text, and color. It was difficult for me to edit the size - is there a way I can better design this?
